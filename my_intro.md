# check the voice

Rather than charging forward or retreating, you decide to investigate the voice that warned you. could it be an ancient guardian, a person, or something else entirely? You call out, "Who are you? What fate do you speak of?" Silence follows for a moment, but then the voice returns, softer this time: "This temple has claimed many lives. What makes you think you will be any different?" You sense that the voice may be more than just a threat; perhaps there is a deeper story here.Perhaps you can negotiate or learn something crucial before proceeding. Taking a deep breath, you steel yourself for the unknown, realizing that this could be a moment of truth. With caution, you move deeper into the temple, following the echoes of the mysterious voice. The air grows colder as you step forward, the weight of unseen eyes watching your every move.
