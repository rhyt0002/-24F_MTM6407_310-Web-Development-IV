# check the voice

Rather than charging forward or retreating, you decide to investigate the voice that warned you. Could it be an ancient guardian, a person, or something else entirely? You call out, "Who are you? What fate do you speak of?" Silence follows for a moment, but then the voice returns, softer this time: "This temple has claimed many lives. What makes you think you will be any different?" You sense that the voice may be more than just a threat; perhaps there is a deeper story here. Perhaps you can negotiate or learn something crucial before proceeding.
