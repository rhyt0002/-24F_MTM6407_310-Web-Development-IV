# check the temple
Before plunging into the unknown, you decide itâ€™s wiser to scout the area around the temple. There might be hidden pathways, secret tunnels, or clues left behind by past adventurers. You carefully circle the ancient structure, eyes peeled for anything unusual. As you do, you notice a faint trail through the overgrown vines and foliage leading to what seems like a collapsed part of the temple. This route could bypass the main entrance and any dangers lurking inside. It's a risky move, but it might give you the upper hand.As you circle the massive stone structure, you notice the intricate carvings on the temple walls. Strange symbols and images of serpents, gods, and warriors in battle cover the stone, their meanings long lost to time.
