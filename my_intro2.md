# check the temple

Before plunging into the unknown, you decide itâ€™s wiser to scout the area around the temple. There might be hidden pathways, secret tunnels, or clues left behind by past adventurers. You carefully circle the ancient structure, eyes peeled for anything unusual. As you do, you notice a faint trail through the overgrown vines and foliage leading to what seems like a collapsed part of the temple. This route could bypass the main entrance and any dangers lurking inside. It's a risky move, but it might give you the upper hand.
