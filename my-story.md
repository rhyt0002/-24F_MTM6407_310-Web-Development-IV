# Retreat to safety

Decide that the risk is too great and leave the temple behind, preferring safety over the unknown threats ahead.
You decide that the risk is too great and leave the temple behind, preferring safety over the unknown threats ahead. The jungle surrounds you once more, offering no immediate danger but also no clear path forward. You feel the weight of your decision, but the sense of self-preservation drives you forward. As you walk away, a faint sound, like a distant bell, rings from the temple, barely audible but unmistakable. The sound lingers in your mind, leaving you with a feeling of unfinished business, but the thought of returning fills you with dread.
