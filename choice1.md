I took a deep breath and slowly approached the shadows where the voice had come from. The air became colder with each step, and the vines twisted as if they were alive. A person appeared from the darkness, shrouded in tattered garments and staring at me with luminous eyes.  

"You seek the Eye of Eternity," it murmured. "Many have died. "None has returned."  

My heart raced as I looked at the temple's towering doors, only a few feet away. Without hesitation, I chose to creep past while the figure mumbled in an ancient tongue. Its attention appeared to be diverted, allowing me to slip by.    


I pulled open the stone doors and dashed inside, breathless. The temple was still, except for a faint hum from the chamber ahead. The Eye of Eternity shone brightly on a pedestal in the centre.

I ignored the warning and reached out to capture the jewel. The ground rocked briefly before remaining motionless. A strange strength flowed through me.

I turned back, stepping outsideâ€”but the jungle was different. Time itself had changed. I realized then that while I had the Eye, I was now trapped in a world that no longer belonged to me.

The Eye had claimed its price.
