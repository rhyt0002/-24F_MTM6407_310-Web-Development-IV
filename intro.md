# Welcome to our crazy Adventure

The wind howled through the dense jungle as you stood at the entrance of the forgotten temple. The legends were true â€“ towering stone statues, covered in vines, guarded the entrance, their eyes seeming to follow your every move. Inside lay the fabled Eye of Eternity, a jewel said to grant its possessor the power to alter time itself.

But not everyone wants you to succeed. As you take a step closer, the ground trembles, and a voice echoes from deep within the shadows: "Turn back now, or face a fate worse than death."

Your heart races. Do you risk everything for the treasure? Or turn back and live to tell the tale?

What do you do next?
